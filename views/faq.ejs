		We use a Risk Based Approach (RBA) towards assessing and managing our clients. We use a credit reference agency to assess each borrower’s credit risk, verify their identity and check their backgrounds. We also perform corporate due diligence on all our borrowers, ensuring all company directors are in good standing. We have an enhanced due diligence process for higher risk customers, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).

	      	Each of our borrowers has been carefully vetted. Borrowers provide a margin deposit to cover potential losses, and positions are automatically closed by the system to protect lenders' funds. In the event that external markets are not able to fulfill the order necessary to close out such positions, TradeMore will act as the counterparty to cover losses. Our team is based in the City of London, and we have professional experience in finance and software development.
