					Bitcoin is a confusing topic. When you run a Bitcoin company, as we do at TradeMore, you find yourself doing a lot of explaining. Common questions include: <i>What is Bitcoin? Where do new Bitcoins come from? Why does it have value; who backs it?</i> These questions are all reasonable, but to answer them you must understand a little of the history of Bitcoin, and the protocol (the rules) behind it. We will not attempt to explain Bitcoin in this article (an excellent introduction can be found <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/">here</a>, and a slightly more technical introduction is <a href="http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/">here</a>). What we will say is that Bitcoin is the first fully functional example of a purely digital currency (many other digital currencies, or 'altcoins', have been derived from Bitcoin) and that the key characteristic of Bitcoin is that it is <i>decentralised</i>. Bitcoin does not operate through large banks and it does not use traditional financial infrastructure. Instead, it uses a peer-to-peer network to send and verify transaction information. Each and every user on the Bitcoin network has a complete record of all previous Bitcoin transactions (a ~20GB data structure called the blockchain) and privacy is ensured by using cryptography to decouple peoples' identities from the transactions they make (specifically, by using  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key cryptography</a>). This is a very different privacy model to that implemented in the traditional economy, as illustrated in this diagram from the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">original bitcoin paper</a>: </br>

				<p>	
					Since Bitcoin is decentralised, anyone in the world can start making and processing transactions; you don't need a banking license, you don't need employees, you don't need an expensive headquarters in the City of London or in Manhattan. 
				</p>	
					<h3>Why does Bitcoin excite us?</h3></br>

				<p>	
					Financial innovation has typically been slow and incremental. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker joked that the only useful financial innovation of the past 20 years was the ATM. Historically, among the most important innovations in finance include double-entry book keeping (1494); the stock exchange (1606), and the central bank (1668). However, while each of these represents an important contribution to finance, they are really just important milestones in what has been a slow evolution of the financial system. </br>
				</p>

				<p>	
					Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin is a radical break with the past. Bitcoin takes us from a centralised banking system to digital currency facilitated by decentralised nodes, with enormous potential benefits, including:
				</p>

					<ul>
					<li><b>Low cost transactions</b>: Digital currency eschews the traditional payment infrastructure, meaning transaction costs can be negligible. The benefits are probably most obvious if we consider international remittances. Every day, hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in tough jobs in foreign countries to make money to send back to their families. Over $400 billion in total annually, according to the World Bank [1]. Banks extract as much as 10% of these transactions in fees, meaning money fails to reach developing nations.</li> </br>

					<li><b>Robust infrastructure</b>: Many banks run outdated software, which is difficult to update due to regulation and fears of interrupting the financial system. Furthermore, governments can and do collapse, which can in turn cause a collapse in the value of local currency, leading to the impoverishment of citizens. Digital currencies operate on top of distributed system, and are robust to node failures.</li> </br>

					<li><b>Anonymity</b>: Digital currency allows individuals to have greater anonymity when transacting over the internet. This could be particularly valuable to those living under repressive regimes. However, Bitcoin is better thought of as being pseudo-anonymous than fully anonymous. The blockchain is public for all to see, and so can be the subject of analysis. Academics Fergal Reid and Martin Harrigan [2] point out that, while users are identified only as public addresses and are encouraged to change these regularly, some linking of addresses is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions (since they must have been owned by the same individual).</li>
					</ul>
				<p>	
					At TradeMore, we believe that these benefits and others will result in digital currencies playing an important role in the the economies of the future. Perhaps Bitcoin will be the most important of these currencies. Perhaps it will be a Bitcoin-variant, like Litecoin or Dogecoin. Perhaps it will be something inspired by Bitcoin, like <a href="">Ethereum</a>. Or perhaps it will be a project we have not yet heard of. Whatever the specific outcome, we believe that blockchain technology could upend traditional financial services, like credit card payments, stock exchanges and international remittances. </br>
				</p>
				<p>
					However, for digital currencies to fulfil this potential, a large number of things must fall into place. Merchants must be able to easily accept digital currency. Consumers must have easy access to digital currency, and be able to spend it with very little friction. And businesses must be able to borrow digital currency, to fund their working capital and manage their risk. And this is precisely what we want to enable through TradeMore. Credit is not part of the Bitcoin protocol. However, the ability to save and borrow play extremely important roles in a modern economy. At TradeMore, we want to introduce credit in to the digital currency ecosystem, beginning with Bitcoin.
